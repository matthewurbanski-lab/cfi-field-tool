# CFI Cheat Sheet (Field Version)

## Universal Field Rules (non-negotiable)
- Photos should go **wide → narrow** so homeowner + crew can orient.
- Capture **access** first (wide angle).
- Capture **baseline hygrometer outside** the entrance (control), then inside.
- Moisture proof sequence (when relevant): **bottom → middle → top**, same vertical plane.
- **All data goes onto the field-sketch** as you photograph it (don’t “remember it later”).
- Finished basements: plan the repair, then account for obstructions.

## Basement Water (Interior Drain + Sump mindset)
- Prove hydrostatic pressure / bottom-up intrusion (cove joint, wall seepage, efflorescence).
- Discharge planning must respect: **topography + obstructions**.

## Crawlspace (Flight Plan prompts)
Confirm:
- Drain measured in **LF** to sump
- **Discharge included?** Route + termination
- Encapsulation measured in **SF**; wall height; seams/tape
- **Need crawl door?**
- Air/dehu coverage matches **cubic area**
- Insulation removal / mold treatment as applicable

## Floor Framing (Units)
- Supplemental beam: **LF**
- Sister joist: **LF**
- Supports (SettleStop/IntelliJack): **EA**

## Concrete (Units)
- Poly stabilization/lift: **SF**
- Crack/joint caulk repair: **LF**
Note: stabilization is the guarantee; avoid promising perfection.

## Wall Stabilization (Measurement Discipline)
- Base → mid → top readings in the same plane.
- Identify movement: bowing vs tipping vs shearing.
- If shearing/complex, verify C-channel requirement + spacing per branch standards.
